I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I've gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.

Hello my friends and community members!  First of all I would like to thank you in reading my request and opportunity.  My family and I run/own a small restaurant in Minnesota.  We are currently looking to expand our business within the metro area.  When we first started out my family took out several high interest credit cards and loans to pay for our business expenses.  We now are a fairly successful restaurant, but personally we need this loan because it is affecting my entire families ability to pay our bills.  We will use this loan to pay off all of the high interest credit card bills so we can concentrate more on making money and building the company.  We could definatley use your help.  Thank you.    My financial situation: (explain why you are a good candidate for paying back this loan) I feel that I am a good candidate of paying back this loan because I have experience, integrity, and the innovation in not only helping repay my investors but most importantly putting the food on the table for my family.  My wife and kids are my life and without them I would be nothing.  I have not been late on a loan or missed a payment for 7 years since I first entered college!  Combined with my 8 years in the services industry and being a top rated business man throughout my years, I feel that I am a great candidate for this loan.  I really need to help pay off these debts and especially for the ones that I love, and with the power of that love, and YOUR HELP, we will enable the opportunity save money, pay off our debts, and setup a plan to place my children through college.

I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.    I would like to request a loan in the amount of $15,000.  I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

Purpose of the Loan:  I would like to pay off a couple of the smaller school loans (some of which have not made it to credit report).  I have researched many consolidation companies and am unsatisfied with the credit results.  Paying loans in full will have a greater impact than consolidations.

This application, VinyasaMT, allows the user to manage projects and data from anywhere in the world. All you need is access to the Internet. The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base – about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of Ford’s approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

I need to rebuild the head on the motor(which alone would cost $2000) which will require me to pull out the motor.  Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.  It was from an AT&T wireless bill from like 2000/2001 which I settled and just popped up with a collection agency.  I called AT&T and they can't even find the account in their systems.  So now I am in the process of trying to resolve it with Pallisades collections.  I am also going to be interested in purchasing the home I currently live in from my parents within the next 2 to 3 years, and want to be able to qualify for a good rate on a loan.  Since I have no long term payment history this would be a good chance for me to build that type of credit.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.

We are currently helping homeowners who are facing foreclosure.   We help those who upside down on their mortgage and facing foreclosure by negotiating a short-sale with the bank and selling their property to a buyer or another investor for a $20,000-$50,000 profit.  We also help homeowners who have equity in their home save their house from foreclosure by bringing their mortgage current and agreeing to share the equity in the property.  The service we provide saves people in tough times and protects their credit so that they can buy a house again in the future.  We also help them with costs that they don't currently have the cash for.  This money will be able to help us with the upfront money to help bring mortgages current and help homeowners with their utilities and other expenses while we negotiate a short-sale with their mortgage company.  My Personal Situation: I have never over extended myself and always paid my bills on time.  I also pay my credit cards in full nearly every month.  I currently have a full-time M-F job as an administrative assistant.  I love what I do, but I would love to be able to create my own schedule, so when I am comfortable with the longevity of the income that we are creating in our real estate investing ventures, I will be able to devote my efforts to that full-time without fear.

I am in the process of having a website designed. This will expand my exposure and availability to a far wider audience. I also wish to increase my direct marketing through brochure and other mailings and e-marketing methods. In addition, I wish to expand my memberships in area chambers of commerce, the Better Business Bureau (who have offered me membership), sustainable building organizations and market related list services. 2.	I wish to improve my skills. I need to cover the cost of purchasing Archicad ? a powerful CAD software -, the cost of instruction, the time to learn it properly, and the purchase of  a plotter (needed with cad). 3.	I wish to improve my office facility. I need a new office sign, plus new office carpeting as well as lighting and furniture.  To put this request in context ? I am a registered architect and have been working in the field for 33 years, and in private practice for 20 years. This is the first time, in all that time, that I have sought a business loan. During that time, I always had an abundance of work, all through referrals. The thrust of my work has always been what is now referred to as Green (environmentally responsible) design. With the change in the economic landscape over the last two years, I have seen the need to improve my business, skills, and marketing to keep up with current market needs. The steps I?ve outlined above are in my mind critical to staying competitive. I am confident in my professional skills and wish to significantly expand the means by which I pursue delivering greater excellence to a wider clientele. To this end, fluency with Cad skills and virtual exposure and connectedness are critical to  meeting the future needs of my clients and business.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.

The 2-room ""new addition"" (built in 1913) risks falling on the neighbor's home. This is because our homes are on a steep hill and this section of my home sits above the neighbor's home.   [More about the project]   The contractor will remove weakened wood members joining this ""new"" addition to the main structure of the house. He will reinforce the addition by ""sistering"" the joists. He will also add additional reinforcement ties (to code) and will secure foundation footing.    [More about the house]   This Queen Anne-style home was built in 1891. It was the first private residence completed by a prominent local architect named T.J.Collins. His work is well-known in this part of the country. The home has not had proper care in over 20 years. Locally, it is a historic treasure that deserves repair.    I was approved for a total home renovation loan, but, that felt like too much debt all at once. Therefore, I'd like to repair and restore in smaller steps. This is the first step, and somewhat urgent.    [More about me, the borrower]   I work for a personal finance company. So, I am very aware of the responsibilities associated with borrowing money. I chose Lending Club because I can responsibly ""pay-as-I-go"" on this restoration project rather than take on too much additional debt at once. I maintain good credit. My lower borrowing score reflects existing mortgage and student loan debt obligations.  Thank you for your interest in my project and your contribution to this loan.

My husband and I have worked in the outdoor adventure/tourism industry for many years in many different capacities. We have over 30 years combined experience managing, guiding, and educating folks in the outdoors.   Please help us fulfill our dream of finally working together in providing our guests with the outdoor experiences they deserve to enjoy a relaxing, enriching, fun adventure with a caring, family-run business.   Please call if you have any questions or would like to come see a beautiful part of Southwest Colorado!  Thank you in advance for your consideration.  We will not disappoint you!

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us.

There are many different aspects to this marketing research, but in a nutshell we provide direct-from-the-customer data, and opinions, which our clients then use to improve service. <br/><br/>As the economy is improving, new areas of potential business are opening in many parts of the US, which also means that our clients are stepping up their marketing research activities. This is good for our business as we seek these opportunities, and continue to build upon them.<br/>",small_business,Helping to Bridge a Credit Crunch,West Hollywood,CA,0,,,,,24.45,0,0,1990-05-28 03:51,0,,,,,,,18,0,,18252,77%,,34,f,0,0,5991.52,5916.62,3367.24,2243.93,0,380.35,3.95,2012-11-01,25.83,null,2013-03-25,,,,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,

I was so happy because I had the money, but I was also really naive to think that a legitimate procedure could cost such a small amount.  Long story short, he ruined my nose, and I've always always regretted getting it done in the first place.  Now I'm 26 and I've never lost sight of trying to fix what the first doctor did.

We buy bank owned houses at .40 to .50 cents on the dollar and then resell them to retail buyers and investors for .80 cents on the dollar. It is great to see new home owners in an affordable house with pre-existing equity. Our company runs about 3 to 5 properties at a time.   Since the current credit meltdown our business lines of credit with two of our banks and loan programs have disappeared. We now need to reinvest most of our profits to fund any new properties we purchase, which is fine, but ties up a lot of our cash and is keeping us from expanding our business.   This loan would help us with a down payment on a great property deal in Portland, Oregon. We just had an offer accepted by Umpqua Bank for $225,000 and need to put 20% down to get financing or $45,000.  We are investing $34,000 of our own cash for the down payment and still need $11,000 to meet the 20% down payment requirement of $225,000. The property is valued at $399,000 which is very conservative market price; two comparables on the same street have sold for about $425,000 in the last 2 months. It is in a great neighborhood by great schools, and it is too good of an opportunity to pass up.  -The loan will be paid off in 6 months to 1 year, after the house is sold or refinanced.

Due to the way the units fell I had to pay for the final semester of college out of pocket. I was going to a private school and the cost per credit was quite high. After graduation I was searching for a job for about a month or so before I had found one. The job I found required me to relocate from California to Texas. The company was supposed to reimburse me for moving expenses however it didn't quite work out that way. After I got there I realized that the company wasn't for me. I also felt that there were too many things left behind back in California that were important to me so I returned home. I've been working a ""transitional"" job for the last few months while searching for another job in my industry.

I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.  I have a full time consulting position but I run an additional side consulting business in a different market and therefore do not compete with my employer.  This loan will pay for lead generation and conversion, marketing materials, and escrow for subcontractors.  After many months of research and study I have determined the best ways to scale my side consulting business using less of my time and efforts.  I will expand through referral systems, passive income products such as information products and software components, and outsourcing development to qualified teams in India, Russia, etc.  My financial situation:  Don't be alarmed by my high revolving balances.  It is essentially a wash.  Whenever I receive a 0% introductory rate on a credit line, I take the money and write out-of-the-money uncovered puts at 30% equity in my brokerage account.  When the introductory rate is close to expiration, I pay the credit line back.  Unlike this loan, the good rates typically only last 6 months.  I have strong character and uphold all my obligations.  I have never missed a payment in my life. This includes the 18 month period when I had a parent near death with cancer surgeries, had my first child with my wife after being cheated out of health insurance ($50,000 loss there even though we're all perfectly healthy and had a perfect delivery), moved from one state to another, and sold two houses (I owned a rental property).

These debts are purchased for 3%-5% of the debt value by my company and completely followed through on via lawsuit, judgment, and execution of the judgment (payment/wage garnishment of the debt). Most collection agencies boast of a 30%-60% return by simply sending out intimidating letters and phone calls. They are simply too large of an operation and have too many accounts to file suit on all of them. By purchasing smaller batches of debts and going through the full legal process, I am able to receive a return of 60%-90% with almost no office expenses.  I have been working for a collection company (US Credit Corp.) for over 3 years collecting taxes and debts, as well as doing work in their legal department. I am well-versed in multi-State collection law, as well as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  These loan funds will be used exclusively to purchase debts and to pay the filing fee associated with each lawsuit.  The combination of my business only being in existence for a few months and the fact that banks don't like to lend on intangible items, makes for a difficult bank-borrowing experience. I tend to pay things off early and pay for things in cash, so I don't have a very lengthy credit history, however my credit scores are still very good. I live on my father's estate, so my living expenses are almost nothing. My only real expenses are my car, food, and the rare occasion that I stop thinking about work and go out and have some fun :) I have 2 credit cards and a small car loan, all of which have never seen a late payment.

Please read the rest  I'm applying for this loan to raise money to donate to any organization in the San Francisco, bay area researching new renewable sources of energy or any group helping to raise awareness of the potential serious danger we are all facing if we don't start taking global warming seriously.   My credit is excellent (see my details) and I don't really need the money. From a common sense point of view it might seem stupid to borrow the money and donate it and then pay interest on it for 3 years. The real benefit I'm hoping to achieve from it is to make Lending Club person-to-person platform work for me to reach 40 people interested in investing 25 dollars each (40x25 = 1,000), I am sure once these lender invest in this loan they will feel a little more involved, and talk about it to others (it  works, trust me). Please do not invest more then 25$ each at this loan, I'm hoping to get all the 40 to contribute.  I haven�t decided yet which organization I will donate the 1,000 to, I'm hoping I will receive lenders suggestions through the questions/answers available from the loan Details page, I will use one of the answers to make my choice public.

I trust you will find this to be a unique, and quite interesting, so I thank you for your support. My business is APK Developments, LLC, which started in 2002 to develop advanced shift systems for the motorsports market. These are semi-automatic shift systems for motorcycles, race cars which use sequential transmissions. In recent years, this has been a booming market due to advancements in manufacturing techniques which have made sequential transmissions more affordable, increasing their demand, and the demand for shift systems to extract the full potential of a sequential setup. The purpose of this loan is capital for the numerous R&D projects current, file for patents, manufacturing add-ons, and brand building.   My current position: I work a day job, so this is done on the side, and has been treated as a hobby so far. This past year I took the next step to make this into something and funded heavily in setting up a place of business, as seen in the above photos. A couple years ago, the MS-100 was developed, which is the fastest air shift system on the market for drag motorcycles. Last year, the MS-120 quick shifter was introduced, which is the only system on the market for motorcycles that automatically adjusts each shift, so that each shift, is at it's optimum. This is one of the things to be patented. Currently, plug and play kits are being developed for popular bikes to provide the customer with a simple installation. Market indications for the MS-120 are great, as there are people waiting for plug and play kits to be available for their bike, however, I can not supply the demand without the needed manufacturing add-ons. Note that a number of these customers have been waiting for months, when they could have gone with the lower priced competitors products. This speaks volumes for my product, which is made to the highest standards.  What's in R&D? A market I didn't forsee with these shift systems is that of mobility aids. I regularly get requests for a system to be developed to up and downshift a motorcycle for disabled riders. This niche would allow injured riders (the primary request) to get back on a bike. I have found one company that produces a viable system, however it is primitive, and I have heard of many comments on it's bulkiness. Everyone requesting me to develop a system compliment the quality present in my products, and hope to see the same in a system designed for this niche. This challenge in R&D has resulted in a system in development, that will need a number of patents filed.  Secondly, is that of the race car market. With paddle shift systems gaining in popularity, there is a need for more cost effective systems for the middle levels of motorsports. For the lower levels (amatuer), higher quality systems at an affordable price.   As for brand building: The website is being completely redesigned (almost done). The company logo has been updated. A marketing plan is in place, and needs to be executed. This is initially done by sponsoring motorcycle racers for the coming season, which is an investment in itself.

We are able to make monthly payments on all our cards, but we are having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. One of our biggest challenges is the gasoline prices that continuously go up.

He works as a deputy sheriff for one county, but we moved to another county(houses alot more reasonable in the county we currently live in). In order for him to work in the county we currently moved to, he would have to apply for the Sheriff's Dept. Unfortunately you can't transfer jobs between counties. In the meantime, he is living with relatives to save on gas so we can continue to pay our bills on time. He comes home on the weekends.

Our income did not match it after it got beyond us and we ended up in debt.  We went to Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and ended up even leading a class helping others to get out of debt and live debt-free as we are in the middle of doing.    We have had NO credit cards (we stopped using them long ago and then cut them up).  We work two jobs each bringing in now around $90K a year.  We live on a budget and cash envelope system.  We make timely payments always on our things (as my credit report will show).  Our credit rating is 720 even after all this. We have added $0 to our debt in the same time period as well!  Though our debt is larger than that we have been paying on, with this loan we would pay off at least one high-interest credit card (we already cut up long ago) and much of a smaller Home Equity loan.  This would bring our number of loans to pay off debt down to two eventually, have a lower interest rate over all, and lower monthly payment - also it would enable us to possibly be in a position to pay off more rapidly the remaining balance on the Home Equity loan.    We have lived on budget, faith, hard work for a year and we are going to kill the debt as we remain on this path.  Our older daughters are also on their own cash envelope system and do not have credit cards, using the Dave Ramsey system as well - they work jobs and pay for much of their own things so we all add no debt.  Our other child is under 13.  We are in good health, pay for good medical insurance, and life insurance and live healthy (no smokers and no alcohol and no gambling or other vices).    Thank you for considering our family for this loan.

I am a very good candidate for this loan with an excellent credit rating. I would much rather pay a slightly higher interest rate here rather than risk getting punished by the CC companies for using them for any extended period of time. Regardless, I do have resources to pay this loan back at any time.  Based upon over 2 years of customer feedback, I believe that this expansion has the potential to double, if not triple our sales and conversion rate within 2-3 months of completion.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!

We are very excited because my wife has three adopted sisters from Africa, and it has been a great experience.  We have great credit and a good income; however the adoption costs are around $25,000 so we would like to use a loan to spread our cash flow out a little.  We will get reimbursed for over half of this loan from my company and from our tax refunds within the next year, so there should be no problem paying the loan back.  We are just trying to not have to dip into our savings too much.  We would greatly appreciate a loan that will help us to make our dream of our first child come true.

My family owns a car dealership, so we don't have a car payment.  We only have our mortgage, a couple of college loans from my Masters degree, and we pay off our credit cards every month and only use them to get airline miles.  I have a good job as a software project manager and make over $80,000 a year.  I also have an extremely good debt to income ratio.  I have a solid history of debt repayment with no late payments ever on my mortgage or credit cards.

I withdrew most of the funds from my brokerage account 3 years ago to pay off a credit card, and to assist a friend in getting rid of some of her inefficient debt a well.  I have since been recompensed over time (charged her no interest).  My mortgage debt is structured very efficiently.  5.0% fixed 30 year mortgage, 5.24% (prime minus 1.26% variable) HELOC.  I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.  And thats a conservative estimate.  My 401K comprises about $110,000 of that. - My monthly take-home from salary is about $4800 - I have one credit card with a balance on it, much of that debt is 0%, and almost half carries a 9.9% rate.  - I am an INTj  Any questions, feel free to ask.

Realizing that many people would likely be willing to buy a product of this high-quality and design, I proposed the idea of setting up a business to produce more for other people (if not only for my friends, who would definitely want one for themselves).  He had previously considered the idea, but figured that he was a great painter, not a great businessman.  That's where I come in.  I told him that I would take care of all the paperwork (licensing legal stuff, setting up an LLC, etc.) and marketing if he would allow me to help him start this business.

My wife and I are partners with her two sisters in a Bed & Breakfast Business. We purchased the Historic Hotel in 1992 so the sisters could realize their dream of running a Bed & Breakfast Inn of their own one day.  My wife of 30 years returned to college at the age of 44 and earned her Associates Degree in Construction Technology/Victorian Restoration, so in 2004 with my wife as the Carpenter and myself as the Electrician/Plumber we gutted the inside, borrowed $100K and spent the next 14 months turning it into an Inn with 3 guest rooms. We opened for business in January 2006 and had a pretty good first year ($36K), but we soon learned that we needed more rooms finished to accommodate the number of guests wanting to stay with us. In April I borrowed $10K from CashCall (39.99%) which we used to get 2 more rooms up and running before the 2007 tourist season. I also bought a computer system for the business from Dell (29.99%). We now have 5 guest rooms and have increased our income to a projected $45K for 2007. We expect our business to keep growing as we become better known and have all 8 rooms available for guests.

The intent of this loan is to simplify my credit situation with a fixed interest rate over a fixed term so that I can pay off my credit card debt more quickly and with less stress.  Previously, I tried to consolidate my unsecured debt with a non-profit organization, but some of my lenders refused to consolidate or even lower my interest rates.   And while the consolidated credit cards were reduced significantly, the others lingered with high interest rates.    By simplifying my credit card debt and moving to a fixed interest and fixed term loan, I can lower my payments and make a solid plan for repayment.    Currently, I am paying nearly 300.00 a month in credit card debt, scattered across several creditors and I am still paying the minimum! My debt seems to be lingering as a result.  My plan is to reduce my payments monthly to $200.00 or less.  My fiance and I would like to be able to pay for the entire wedding out-of-pocket and without extensive use of credit resources.  Because I am putting so much out each month in credit card debt, my ability to save has been slim.

They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I realize the responsibility required for the transition I am about to make, and debt consolidation is only the begining step.  I have been stable in my position with Lithia Motors as one of their leading IT Professionals for 2 years now, and have raised my credit score out of the depths from my earlier years growing up and experiencing the world.  In addition Federal and State funds are making their way back to me per this year's tax season.  This will help me achieve paying this debt back quicker than just my base salary alone.  Most of my immediate family also resides in this region, and we have always helped each other in times of need.

Although my wonderful father paid for my tuition through school, I was living on my own all through school and depended on a part-time job and credit cards to pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc.   After I graduated, I was lucky enough to find my dream job rather quickly.  A junior accountant at a small,local CPA firm.  I have been there for 2 years now and have since been promoted to a senior.  Since getting this new job, I have gotten my debt down from 13,000 to 4,500.  I have contacted all the credit card companies asking for lower rates, but they say I cant have one because of the missed payments from years ago.  I feel so overwhelmed sometimes, I cant sleep.  I have 3 different credit cards all due at different times not to mention a car payment, rent, utilities, etc.  I have asked all the credit card companies for higher limits so I could consolidate to make one payment, but again, 2-3 years ago, when I was working 20 hours a week at a grocery store and going to school full time I had late payments and overdraft charges (mostly due to the late payment fees).  I am asking for this loan so that I can finally be free of this debt, and stop it from looming over my head.  I am planning to get married this fall and we both hope to be debt free before then, so we will be able to start saving for a house.

When compounding interest enters into the equation I end up only paying off a small percentage of the principal. For the past year I have been paying $400-500 a month towards credit debt and need a solution to compounding interest.   The idea of having a fixed rate is exactly what I am looking. Yes, the rates may be higher then traditional lenders but I like the concept of this new type of lending because there is a little more forgiveness towards the borrower.

I don't have a mortgage, my income exceeds my expenses and I'm very meticulous about spending.  I have good control over myself mentally, spiritually and emotionally, therefore I have good control over my money. My only debt is a car lease and a interest free care credit loan for my lasik (i could have paid cash but why not get interest free financing).  My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?  Again, this is for the experience, I can comfortably afford the loan and interest, but I think this experience will make me better in business.

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar’s ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read… well I won’t digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

Our goal is threefold:  To obtain lower rates through conventional means only (as RAISING our credit score is important to us), accelerate the pace at which we are paying current debt and to eliminate debt in revolving accounts completely within 24 months.

Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location – walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan – I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value – I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

A year ago I had been in a bad position financially after my roommate left me with a lease. I reluctantly resorted to using credit cards to help offset the added expense. I have 4 credit cards. I paid off one with highest interest about a month ago. I am content with keeping my Amex with 7.9% fixed.  The 2 cards I'd like to consolidate are 11.9% fixed and 13% variable with combined balances of about $6131.29.

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February. My gross income for 2007 was $85,000 with a base salary of $20,000 and commissions of $65,000 for the year.   If you notice on my credit report, I have not missed a payment on any debt. I wish to keep it that way and am looking for a loan to consolidate some of the monthly payments and reduce the total amount of my long-term debt.

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with yoy.",debt_consolidation,Personal Loan to Consolidate Debt,San Diego,CA,0,,,,,10.14,1,0,1995-07-30 03:46,1,22,,,,,,9,0,,3608,37.6%,,20,f,0,0,12305.28,9312.05,9999.99,2305.29,0,0,0,2011-05-12,102.89,null,2011-05-05,,,,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,

The business provides at-risk homeowners options to prevent foreclosure and keep their homes through lender negotiations.  The current owners are retiring due to their age and health.  The working capital portion of the funds will be used to improve processes and systems.  The business has not fully utilized current technology and I intend to convert certain manual processes to automated ones, increasing efficiency.  This increase in efficiency will translate into increased productivity, revenues and net income.  I have been a self-employed CPA since 2006, assisting clients in a variety of accounting and financial projects.  My wife is a Director in an IT department of a large publicly-traded company, and will continue to be a secondary source of income.  After reviewing several other businesses, this was the first opportunity that met both of our approvals.  The sellers are extremely supportive of this transaction.  Throughout the sales process, they have been extremely selective.  They met and rejected 46 other potential buyers before telling my wife and me that I was the first person that they felt comfortable to continue the business.  Additionally, they are providing ongoing consulting services for 3-6 months after the close date.

I was a long time renter and finally decided to take the plunge and buy a house.  The house is comfortable and livable but it is over 80 years old and requires some work in order to nip some problems in the bud and prevent them from becoming bigger problems.  The house needs new windows and vinyl siding, for example.  I would use the extra money to pay off my credit cards.  Over the course of the past year I've put a lot of charges on my credit cards related to fixing up this house.  It would be a big relief for me to pay off my cards and make one set monthly payment.

Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.   An average loan is small, usually  $75-$100 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for  60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $75.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the ship are: Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank. Purchasing gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry). Providing other financial services such as money orders, money transfers, tax preparation, prepaid phone cards, etc.     For more information on modern day, professional managed pawn shops check out this link: http://www.cashamerica.com/casham.html",other,Pawn Shop,Overland Park,KS,0,,,,,7.17,0,0,1991-08-13 03:32,1,,,,,,,14,0,,9409,11.1%,,26,f,0,0,8460.61,219.76,7500,960.61,0,0,0,2011-05-04,236.36,null,2011-04-12,,,,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,

It's a large (over 1200 square feet), walkout basement with lots of natural light.  It's just begging to be a more usable area.  I want to add 2 bedrooms, a bath room (the rough-in is already present), a living area, kitchenette (microwave, fridge, and cabinets), and a room that could be used as either an office, exercise room, or spare bedroom.  I am moving into the house at the end of May and want to have the basement finished by the end of the summer.  I'm a math professor, which means that I can work from home some in the summer and have more flexibility with my schedule than I can during the fall and spring semesters.  Thus, I'm trying hard to get this taken care of this summer.  I'm single, and I prefer to have housemates instead of living alone.  I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for other young professionals with whom to share.  It seems that there are a lot of us who prefer to share housing, and I have had a lot of interest.  Thus, after I finish the basement, I plan to rent it to other young professionals.  My calculations indicate that this investment will pay for itself in about 4 years.   Of course, it will also increase the value of the home.  About me:  I finished graduate school a year ago, with a Ph.D. in math.  I'm now a math professor, which means that I do research in mathematics and teach math courses to undergraduates.  I am heavily involved in the mathematical education of teachers.  I like to teach math classes designed for those who are trying to become teachers, as well as professional development or master's courses for those who are already practicing teachers.  I'm currently a math professor in the south.  I'm a post-doc, which is a temporary 1-3 year position that you get after your degree to give you more experience so that you can get a permanent position.  It worked.  I will be starting a permanent (tenure track) position in Colorado this summer.  I want to settle permanently in Colorado, and I hope that I will work at this same University until I retire.

Unfortunately, this has been a strain on my schoolwork, but I have also kept a 3.2 GPA and last semester I even made the Dean’s List. I currently attend a major university part time and have been going to school for the past six years.  In the past I have been able to handle the stresses of working and going to school, but I graduate at the end of the year and I just found out a few days ago that I would need to complete three more classes this summer in order to graduate on time. This is very distressing news, because I work every single day during the summer months to pay for the following semester. I would like to graduate on time, it has been a very long six years and I want to be the first person in my family to have a college degree.  I do not want to push my graduation off any further.  I plan to graduate with a BA in Spanish History/Interrupter Education. I would like to be an Interrupter and also a Spanish Language Arts teacher after I graduate. Spanish language and learning about other countries has been a wonderful experience. I love learning about other cultures and studying this language has taught me so much about how other people live and how learning a new language has brought down so many barriers. So far I have not had a chance to travel oversees, but I plan to do so after my graduation.  I love attending school and I have been able to pay all of my education expenses so far, but these three classes will be a strain on me financially.  I want to be able to complete and pay for these three classes and always pay for the following semester and graduation fees.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.

No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

After reading Suze Orman's book, I learned that this is the one time it is o.k. to accumulate credit card debt.  During the first few months alone, I was not making rent in a bi-monthly paycheck.  Since then, my business has picked up and I've branched into other areas of the industry.  The biggest venture was becoming a Stott Certified Pilates Instructor.  The cost  of the certification added to my debt with the understanding that I would be able to start taking clients after all the trainings.  My income is now doing better with the exception of having to pay well over the minimum payment due just to keep the balance moving downward toward complete payoff.  Unfortunately, the debt has seemed to be on a standstill for a while now.  My sister has had her debt on here and recommended that it was a better option to pay off the accumulated charges.  As a young professional, I knew it would be tough to pay off the debt without adding more charges.  It's a vicious cycle that seems to go nowhere.  Having Pilates as a third source of income has been helping with my bill payments, but  is still overwhelming at this time.  It would be a huge help to have one steady payment each month, instead of fluctuating minimum balance payments.
