This repo houses development for a machine learning based risk valuation package.  Initially, publically available data from LendingClub (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) will be used for development.  This software also will utilize the python scikit-learn api for machine learning functionality; instructions for how to install scikit-learn and its dependencies can be found @ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html.
